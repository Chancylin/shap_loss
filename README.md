# Toy Example: SHAP loss values for model debugging and monitoring
## Jupyter Notebook
*Census income classification with XGBoost_shap_loss.ipynb*<br>
* **Description:** an top example to illustrate the calculation of shap loss values and its use for model debugging and monitoring, modified based on [a tutorial example](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/tree_explainer/Census%20income%20classification%20with%20XGBoost.ipynb) from [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) package. <br>

*Explaining the Loss of a Model.ipynb* <br>
* **Description:** a quick example to show the calculation of shap loss values, [a tutorial example](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/tree_explainer/Explaining%20the%20Loss%20of%20a%20Model.ipynb) from SHAP package.
